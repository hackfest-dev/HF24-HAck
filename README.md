# OPTILog: Optimized Logistics Solution for Efficient Inter-Modal Freight Movement

## Team HAck

### Problem Statement

India's extensive Logistics Parks infrastructure necessitates efficient management of cargo movement between ports and widely spread MMLPs. It's crucial to determine the most cost-effective flow of goods within the transportation network, considering ports as origins, MMLPs as destinations, and the routes between them (including roads, railways, and waterways) as connections with respective capacities and costs per kilometer. The objective is to meet the demand at MMLPs while keeping the overall transportation expenses as low as possible within this intricate network.

### Solution Overview

Our solution, OPTILog, aims to optimize logistics operations for efficient inter-modal freight movement in India. Leveraging advanced algorithms and data analytics, OPTILog offers a comprehensive approach to tackle the complexities of cargo movement within the transportation network. 

To achieve this, OPTILog utilizes the GNU Linear Programming Library to implement optimization algorithms for route planning and resource allocation. Additionally, we develop an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) using React.js and Tailwind CSS. This GUI provides users with a seamless experience to interact with the solution, visualize data, and make informed decisions regarding logistics operations.
